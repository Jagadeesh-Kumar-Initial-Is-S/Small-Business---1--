### Brief

The website is designed to function correctly on various devices. This is a Simple E-commerce Website that has a Product slider with images, a Product section with Product Card, and all the necessary features that E-commerce websites have.

### HTML Code

The Skelton system (the frame/structure of bones) of the human body gives a structure/layout to the human body. Similarly, HTML code does the same it gives the layout of the websites.
This website has three main sections:-
1.Header(Navigation bar/menu/logo,etc.)
2.Main section(main content).
3. Footer.

### CSS

The structure of the website layout is completed but it doesn’t look good without styling. Human skeletal alone can’t look good without skin. So here the work of styling is done with the help of  CSS.
The work of styling is done with the help of  CSS are follwings:

1. Flexbox.
2.CSS basics(selectors,color,border-box,etc).
3.pseduo effects(hover, active) and pseudo elements(before).
4.media queries(responsive) and keyframes(animation).

### JavaScript Code

A website with only structure and styling is like a person is sleeping (It can’t perform any functions). So for the well functioning of the website we use Javascript.
For the well functioning of the website I used JavaScript implementing the following:

1. DOM (Document Object Model) Manipulation.
2. Javascript basics.
