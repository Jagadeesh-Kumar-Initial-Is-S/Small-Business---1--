## Task

Design and develop a responsive, mobile-friendly website for a fictional small business. The website should include the following pages:
● Home page: A landing page that provides an overview of the business and its services
● Contact us: A page that includes a form for visitors to send inquiries or requests for more information

The website should be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and should make use of responsive design techniques to ensure that it looks and functions correctly on a variety of devices.

<hr />

### Brief

The website is designed to function correctly on various devices. This is a Simple E-commerce Website that has a Product slider with images, a Product section with Product Card, and all the necessary features that E-commerce websites have.

<hr />

### Icons

The icons are taken from ionicons.

<hr />

### Coding Languages

I coded with html, css and javascript to build the website.

<hr />

### HTML Code

The Skelton system (the frame/structure of bones) of the human body gives a structure/layout to the human body. Similarly, HTML code does the same it gives the layout of the websites.<br />
This website has three main sections:-
<br />
1.Header(Navigation bar/menu/logo,etc.)<br />
2.Main section(main content).<br />
3. Footer.

<hr />

### CSS

The structure of the website layout is completed but it doesn’t look good without styling. Human skeletal alone can’t look good without skin. So here the work of styling is done with the help of  CSS.
The work of styling is done with the help of  CSS are follwings:
<br />
1. Flexbox.<br />
2.CSS basics(selectors,color,border-box,etc).<br />
3.pseduo effects(hover, active) and pseudo elements(before).<br />
4.media queries(responsive) and keyframes(animation).  

<hr />

### JavaScript Code

A website with only structure and styling is like a person is sleeping (It can’t perform any functions). So for the well functioning of the website we use Javascript.<br />
For the well functioning of the website I used JavaScript implementing the following:
<br />
1. DOM (Document Object Model) Manipulation.<br />
2. Javascript basics.

<hr />

### Deployed URL

The website is deployed on vercel. The deployed URL's link is eual to https://small-business-1.vercel.app/ .

<hr />

### Source code

The source code had been uploaded to GitHub. The surce code's link is equal to https://github.com/Jagadeesh-Kumar-Initial-Is-S/Small-Business---1-- .

## Questions And Answers

### Can you describe the process you followed to design and develop the website for the fictional small business?

I created navigation bar to navigate inside the website.

The JavaScript is included to adding functions to the website.

The following skills are necessary for creating the website. They are the essential components you should possess for creating the website:
<br />
1. HTML.<br />
2. CSS.<br />
3. JavaScript.

### How did you ensure that the website was responsive and mobile-friendly?

The work of styling is done with the help of  CSS to ensure that the website was responsive and mobile-friendly are follwings:
<br />
1. Flexbox.<br />
2.CSS basics(selectors,color,border-box,etc).<br />
3.pseduo effects(hover, active) and pseudo elements(before).<br />
4.media queries(responsive) and keyframes(animation). 

### Did you face any challenges during the development process, and if so, how did you address them?

I took a lot of time to create the website. One of the issue was that I didn't know a lot about iframe tag. Later I tried many time and made the website to run successfully. I was unable to swallow some water while creating the website.

### Can you provide examples of how you used responsive design techniques to make the website look and function correctly on different devices and screen sizes?

1. Firstly style the header. Using the Flex property to align every flex item in the header in a line.
Then using the same for the search menu and heading lists as flexbox. then align them in a  horizontal line using properties.<br />
2. Setting the visibility of the menu class and heading class to be hidden because it should appear when the size of the screen is less. (when we are using it on phones or tab).<br />
3. Appling other properties and hover effects(the HOVER effect works when the cursor goes over the tag on which it is applied) to the header files as shown below.<br />
4. Using the keyframe property which is used for the animation (I use it for the image slider).<br />
5. Appling styling on the items/products and their classes (flex and some other properties).<br />
6. Similarly, appling some styling on the Footer.<br />
7. Using the media queries property to make it responsive and inside it mention the properties you want to see when the size of a screen is small.
finally, check your website is ready.<br />
8. when the size of the screen is small the website was able to open the menu list.
And so I solved this problem using Javascript.

### Can you share any lessons learned or best practices that you followed during the development process?

1. The development process made me faster in coding programming languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br />
2. Practice makes perfect.<br />
3. The creation of navigation bar isn't too hard.<br />
4. I made a design to create  the website then I processed the creation of the website.
